                        <br>
                        My name is Mona Essaid and I am a full-stack developer from Los Angeles, CA. I am a recent
                        graduate with a master’s degree in Software Development from the University of Glasgow in
                        Scotland. But my undergraduate degree was not in tech - I love telling stories and solving
                        problems creatively, so I chose to study marketing during my bachelors degree. I decided that I
                        wanted to pursue a career in tech during the last semester of my undergraduate degree. I took a
                        user experience design course and loved the combination of creative problem solving, psychology,
                        and technical challenges that it offered.
                        <br><br>
                        After I graduated, I worked in a variety of fields with the goal of continuing to learn more
                        about technology in my free time so I could eventually transition into more technical roles. I
                        was able to learn more about front-end web development through the Grow with Google Scholarship
                        that I received in 2018, and I independently studied Java and JavaScript over the years as well.
                        I decided to go back to school to formally study software development and gain the skills I
                        needed to change my career in 2022. I loved living and studying in a different environment, and
                        being immersed in another culture gave me valuable perspective.
                        <br><br>
                        Since I came back to the US in early 2024, I have been working on personal projects,
                        earning certifications, and fine-tuning my master’s thesis project with the goal of releasing it
                        in early 2025. I joined the Cook Systems FastTrack program in November 2024. During the program,
                        I have completed backend projects in Java, SpringBoot, and Node, and frontend projects with
                        html, CSS,
                        JavaScript, and Angular. I look forward to continuing to refine my technical skills and
                        continuing my career in software development with Cook Systems.
